            <img src="https://nusahati.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tsai-Lun-Penemu-Kertas.jpg" class="responsive-image"> 
            <p>Although various forms of writing material existed before, true paper as we know it today was invented in ancient China by Cai Lun, an official in the Han Dynasty. He developed a method for producing paper using a mixture of mulberry bark, hemp, rags, and fishnets. This invention led to the widespread use of paper across the empire, changing the course of history.</p>

            <span class="date">650–750 A.D. - Paper Spreads to the Islamic World:</span>
            <p>With the expansion of the Islamic Empire, Chinese papermaking techniques spread to Central Asia and the Middle East. This was accelerated by the Battle of Talas in 751, where Chinese papermakers were captured and brought to Samarkand, a city that became a key center for papermaking in the Islamic world.</p>

            <span class="date">800–1100 A.D. - Paper Reaches Europe:</span>
            <p>Papermaking spread from the Islamic world to North Africa and eventually to Europe through Spain, where it was introduced around the 11th century. By the 13th century, European countries such as Italy had established their own paper mills, adapting techniques from the Islamic world and refining them to produce higher quality paper.</p>

            <span class="date">15th Century - The Printing Revolution:</span>
            <p>With the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440, the demand for paper skyrocketed across Europe. Books, pamphlets, and printed materials became accessible to a wider audience, sparking an age of knowledge sharing and literacy growth.</p>

            <p>Nicolas-Louis Robert, a Frenchman, invented the first continuous paper machine, which mechanized the production of paper. This was further developed in England by Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier, who created the Fourdrinier machine, laying the foundation for modern papermaking.</p>

        <li>
            <span class="date">19th Century - Wood Pulp Revolution:</span>
            <p>As the demand for paper grew, alternative sources to cotton and linen were needed. Wood pulp became the primary material for papermaking, greatly reducing costs and making paper more widely available. This change was a major turning point, leading to the mass production of paper and an expansion of the publishing industry.</p>
